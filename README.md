# Project Name
Full Stack to do list
## Description

This is a to do list that lets a user add a task, including a priority level and a due date. This information is then sent to the databse where it is stored.  A user is given the option to mark a task as complete which will change the boolean value of "completed" to true on the server, this will also move the task to the Completed table on the DOM and change the background color to green. Chosing different priority levels will give the to-do tasks different background colors indicating a different level of urgency, not chosing one leaves no background color, low priority is blue, medium yellow and high is red. The user may also delete the task from either Current tasks and from completed tasks which will both delte it from the server.
This project uses html, css, javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Ajax, and postrgres.
